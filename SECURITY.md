# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please send a message on
[this discussion](https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/1861) sharing how we can contact you (e.g. your email).

We'll contact you as soon as possible, with a proof that we are who we claim we are (you can also validate it 
[here](https://github.com/orgs/encode/teams/operations)). Then you can reply with the vulnerability.

Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

We will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.

Thanks for your help!
