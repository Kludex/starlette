GraphQL support in Starlette was deprecated in version 0.15.0, and removed in version 0.17.0.

To not let the users lost when integrating with GraphQL, we would like to recommend the following alternatives:

- [Ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/docs/starlette-integration.html)
- [`starlette-graphene3`](https://github.com/ciscorn/starlette-graphene3#example)
- [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/starlette)
- [`tartiflette-asgi`](https://tartiflette.github.io/tartiflette-asgi/usage/#starlette)

Those tutorials should be enough to get you started with the GraphQL integration.
